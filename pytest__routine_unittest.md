## 1. What is a Unit Test?
A unit test is a fundamental part of software testing where individual units or components of a software application are isolated and tested to verify that they perform as expected. Each unit test focuses on a specific portion of code, ensuring that it behaves correctly under various conditions.

## 2. Where and Why Unit Tests are Used
### Location
Unit tests are typically located within the same codebase as the units they test, often in a separate directory or alongside the code they validate.
### Purpose
- **Ensure Correctness:** Verify that each unit of code performs its intended functionality correctly.
- **Facilitate Refactoring:** Provide confidence that changes to the codebase do not break existing functionality.
- **Early Detection of Issues:** Catch bugs and errors early in the development process, reducing the cost of fixing them later.

## 3. How Unit Tests are Implemented
### Framework
In our project, pytest is employed as the primary testing framework for Python. Pytest offers simplicity, flexibility, and powerful features for writing and running tests.
### Structure
Our unit tests follow a structured approach:
- **Naming Conventions:** Tests are named descriptively, indicating the function or feature being tested and the expected behavior.
- **Organization:** They are organized into logical groups within the `/tests` directory, maintaining clarity and ease of navigation.
### Execution
Unit tests are executed:
- **Locally:** Developers run tests on their local development environment using pytest or integrated development environments (IDEs) with built-in testing capabilities.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines are set up using GitHub Actions, ensuring that tests run automatically on each commit and pull request, guaranteeing code quality and reliability.



## 4. Example of a Unit Test

### Testing a Python Function with pytest


```python
# Module: calculator.py

def add(a, b):
    """Adds two numbers."""
    return a + b
```
    


### Test Module: test_calculator.py
```python
import pytest

### Test Case Results
from calculator import add

def test_add_positive_numbers():
    """Test addition of positive numbers."""
    assert add(2, 3) == 5

def test_add_positive_and_negative():
    """Test addition of positive and negative numbers."""
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0

def test_add_negative_numbers():
    """Test addition of negative numbers."""
    assert add(-1, -1) == -2  
```    

### Test Case Results

### Example Test Case Results

- **Test Case 1: Addition of Positive Numbers**
  - **Description:** Verifies that adding positive numbers yields correct sum.
  - **Expected Result:** `add(2, 3)` should return `5`.
  - **Actual Result:** Passed.

- **Test Case 2: Addition of Positive and Negative Numbers**
  - **Description:** Checks addition of positive and negative integers.
  - **Expected Result:** `add(-1, 1)` should return `0`.
  - **Actual Result:** Passed.

- **Test Case 3: Addition of Negative Numbers**
  - **Description:** Tests addition of two negative numbers.
  - **Expected Result:** `add(-1, -1)` should return `-2`.
  - **Actual Result:** Passed.

## Integration with Software Testing Strategy

### Role in Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

Unit tests are seamlessly integrated into our CI/CD pipelines:

- **Automated Testing:** GitHub Actions execute tests upon code commits and pull requests, providing immediate feedback and ensuring code quality standards are met.
- **Preventing Regressions:** Unit tests help detect regressions early, preventing issues from reaching production environments.
